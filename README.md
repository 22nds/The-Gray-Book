50 - serious visual programming
==

An introduction to software development using the development environment 50.

50 is: 
* a visual programming language
* a development environment for the same
* a node and data type library

50 can
* compile and run code dynamically

50 is available as
* a package for vvvv45

50 is targeted at developers who 
* prefer visual over textual code
* prefer interactive prototyping programming over edit/compile/fix error/compile/run
* are looking for data flow, object oriented and functional style programming metaphors 

We'll mainly be looking at things pure 50, and still see the differences to vvvv45 here and there. The focus yet is on explaining pure 50 from the ground up, thus working as a guide for the still to upcoming standalone system. A special chapter will show how to integrate 50-nodes into your vvvv45 projects.

We are still in an early stage of carefully building the library. We'll give you an overview of what's there and how to solve problems you couldn't attack with vvvv45. We'll highlight some known design patterns when things get bigger and show you how to modularize, break up patches and create you own basic building blocks by combining just a few nodes. We' ll explain some of the basic building blocks like TogEdge and S+H by looking at the patches defining them.
