### Changes
* Xenko is now Stride. So we needed to switch as well.
* Runtime Warnings: The Warn node allows you to emmit warnings at runtime, allowing a library developer to communicate with the user in a soft way. A node gets orange (not pink), no exceptions are involved, no runtime hick-up, no panic. 
* Descriptive Tree Patching: With the TreeNodeParentManager & TreeNodeChildrenManager you can ensure that the user gets warned when the object graph patched via process nodes is no tree. 
* SingleInstancePerApp: A singleton mechanism that work per entry point (e.g. a help patch)
* S&R nodes (send & receive). These work per app. (Help patches will not collide when using the same channels). These make use of runtime warnings if something is off.
* `This` node allowing to access the own instance from within an instance operation, thus being able to call instance operations on yourself. Current limitations: Doesn't work in generic patches. Doesn't work on Create.
* Input pin groups now are visualized. There is also interaction support for more than one.
* GetLiveDataHubForSerializedID allows to inspect any data hub.
* DefaultValueInjection: When deactivating a fragment of a process node, all inputs get reset before the fragment isn't called anymore.
* Multiple node factories per assembly, little changes in IVLNodeDescriptionFactory
* State dispose fix in reactive foreach - now done on thread which created it
* Removed IDisposable constraint on ResourceProvider
* Serialization stackoverflow protection
* Skia fixes: SkiaSharp 1.68.0 -> 1.68.2-preview.45; window fullscreen fix; GRContext in CallerInfo
* Added handy math nodes: OneOver, OneMinus, ByTwo, ByHalf, etc
* Mainloop node to control the Application main loop
