### Changes
* Now shipping with VL.Video.MediaFoundation package including VideoIn and VideoPlayer nodes that return a texture
* Now shipping with TextureFX: sources, filters, mixer and utilities
* New ForEach (Max) loop region taking the iteration count from the maximum of its inputs
* The compiler uses a different strategy which greatly reduces the compile and hotswap time in bigger projects. For details see [discussion](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/ui-performance-issues/18638) in the forums.
* The register services method is only called when starting a patch, it will no longer be called while patching. This should save resources and make it much more predictable.
* Adds extension methods `IVLObject.TryGetPath` and `IVLObject.IsSupportedCollectionType` (ported from VL.Elementa). The used traversal methods also support dictionaries now.
* Methods marked with the `Obsolete` attribute will show up with a warning in VL
* Adds new `Optional<T>` type with serialization and editor support. An `Optional<T>` IO box always represent the `HasValue` state. The `HasNoValue` state can simply be achieved by not connecting at all.
* Lifts all remaining restrictions on the `This` node. It can now be used in `Create` as well as in generic patches. For details see https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/21 
* The node path is now made out of unique (and persistent) ids. Elements can be identified across sessions. The old APIs are still in place for compatibility reasons. To make use of the new ones one needs to adjust the patches making use of it.
* Skia:
  * Resize node is reworked internally, Output Size pin is defined as Int2 instead of Vector2, switched from Class to Processnode. The old node is moved to `Obsolete`.
  * New: Resize (Relative), Crop, Crop (Relative) 


### Fixes
* Fixes null reference exception when calling GetFiles/GetDirectories/GetDescendants on empty path object (could be backported)
* Fixes some emit crashes when using special character or reserved keywords
* Fixes renaming of various elements. The rename will also only be applied after the user commits to it and not on every key stroke.
* Export will also work if runtime is stopped
* Reduces the amount of generated ad-hoc projects - fixes cases where shaders would overlap on export
* Fixes same shaders subfolder being copied to multiple exported projects
* Exporter will now add a package reference to the original nuget in case it generates the project belonging to that same package - ensures that all the build targets of the package get picked up / files get copied to the output folder
* Fixes serializer not preserving the runtime type of the root element 
* Fixes slice states not getting disposed if used in nested loop and `Keep` is false in first frame
* Fixes emit exception when the content of an adaptive implementation was inlined
* Fixes SKImageFilter and SKColorFilter tooltips
