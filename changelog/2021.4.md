### Changes
* Now shipping with VL.Video.MediaFoundation package including VideoIn and VideoPlayer nodes that return a texture
* Added support for [editor extensions](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/extending/editor-extensions.html)
* Added a Hamburger menu for easy changing of settings and themes
* The compiler uses a different strategy which greatly reduces the compile and hotswap time in bigger projects. For details see [discussion](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/ui-performance-issues/18638) in the forums.
* Methods marked with the `Obsolete` attribute will show up with a warning in VL
* The register services method is only called when starting a patch, it will no longer be called while patching. This should save resources and make it much more predictable.
* Adds extension methods `IVLObject.TryGetPath` and `IVLObject.IsSupportedCollectionType` (ported from VL.Elementa). The used traversal methods also support dictionaries now.
* Lifts all remaining restrictions on the `This` node. It can now be used in `Create` as well as in generic patches. For details see https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/21 
* The node path is now made out of unique (and persistent) ids. Elements can be identified across sessions. The old APIs are still in place for compatibility reasons. To make use of the new ones one needs to adjust the patches making use of it.
* Optional Explicit Type Parameters added. For details see https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/39

### Core Lib
* New ForEach (Max) loop region taking the iteration count from the maximum of its inputs
* Adds new `Optional<T>` type with serialization and editor support. An `Optional<T>` IO box always represent the `HasValue` state. The `HasNoValue` state can simply be achieved by not connecting at all.
* Added a TypeOf node
* LinearSpread now with lot of more options, LinearSpread (Range) added
* Added RandomSpread (4D)
* Added GridSpread (2D/3D) nodes
* Added a TempPath node
* Added Determinant and ScalingVector to Matrix
* Added option for clock and [ImagePlayer synchronization](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/best-practice/video-synchronization.html)

### Skia:
  * Resize node is reworked internally, Output Size pin is defined as Int2 instead of Vector2, switched from Class to Processnode. The old node is moved to `Obsolete`.
  * New: Resize (Relative), Crop, Crop (Relative) 
* Custom Regions API added. This allows to patch a region with BorderControlPoints
* Added ImagePlayer node for .dds sequence playback

### Stride
* Now shipping with TextureFX: sources, filters, mixer and utilities
* New PostFX: Fog and Outline
* Reworked Buffer and Texture nodes
* All materials have ShaderFX inputs
* Shader node factory for ShaderFX nodes
* Shader nodes can have ShaderFX inputs
* Materials can be extended with custom shaders
* ShaderFX inputs of values and vectors can be conencted directly to IOBoxes
* Shaders get `ViewSize`, `AspectRatio`, `Time` and `TimeStep` automatically set by the runtime
* High quality resize filters to scale textures
* Many new shader utils and functions
* ImagePlayer to play back image sequences
* TextureWindow for eas texture preview
* Pipet node to sample texture pixels
* BufferReadback for non-blocking buffer value download to the CPU
* Mesh split nodes to read vertex data
* Width and Height pins are replaced with one Int2 Size pin
* Ambient occlusion works with orthographic camera
* Fixes for Spout sender and receiver
* Stride windows move to fron on open
* Experimental multiple view ports support
* Experimental way to efficiently render from multiple perspectives into multiple textures
* Many small improvements and fixes
* Shader node factory for ShaderFX nodes
* All shader nodes can have ShaderFX inputs
* Added ImagePlayer node for .dds image sequence playback

### Fixes
* Fixes null reference exception when calling GetFiles/GetDirectories/GetDescendants on empty path object (could be backported)
* Fixes some emit crashes when using special character or reserved keywords
* Fixes renaming of various elements. The rename will also only be applied after the user commits to it and not on every key stroke.
* Export will also work if runtime is stopped
* Reduces the amount of generated ad-hoc projects - fixes cases where shaders would overlap on export
* Fixes same shaders subfolder being copied to multiple exported projects
* Exporter will now add a package reference to the original nuget in case it generates the project belonging to that same package - ensures that all the build targets of the package get picked up / files get copied to the output folder
* Fixes serializer not preserving the runtime type of the root element 
* Fixes slice states not getting disposed if used in nested loop and `Keep` is false in first frame
* Fixes emit exception when the content of an adaptive implementation was inlined
* Render Windows that are "Bound To Document" will now always close the right document, even if the windows got wrapped in a helper node.
* Definitions in application patch get same categorization as the definitions in the definitions patch.
* Link tooltip comes with a delay as specified in the settings (if warning or error or Ctrl or Space)
* Fixes SKImageFilter and SKColorFilter tooltips
* Refinements on TextureViewer potentially showing the texture info before the content becomes available.
* Pinned tooltips are now less verbose
* Fixes PerspectiveLookAtRect. Scaling part now moved to ProjectionMatrix making a LookAtRectCam work with more shaders.
* Simplified pin group keyboard shortcuts
