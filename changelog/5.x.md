# vvvv gamma 5.0
[Download preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download)

## New
* Update to .NET 6
* Update to Stride 4.1
* Support for "new" nuget packages
* Packages get pre-compiled. Saves startup time and memory.
* C# projects can be referenced directly
* Exporter stores its settings in `*.props` file. That file (and / or optional `*.targets` file) can be used to define custom actions on export.
* New command (Ctrl + Shift + K) to create getters and setters (accessors) for selected pads in one go
* All libraries are open source (VL.StandardLibs)
* Exported applications are of smaller size, they no longer have a dependency on VL.Lang
* All packages (nuget or source) do by default get pre-compiled. With the `--editable-packages` startup flag one can opt-out of this behaviour.
* Adds new package `VL.TestFramework` which can be used by external libraries to test their documents

## Changes
* Exported apps no longer have a `lib` subfolder where all the assemblies are. It wasn't possible to support this directory layout.
* Better ordering of search results (Ctrl + ,)
* Tooltip shows file path of shaders

## Fixes
* Opening recently saved documents should no longer showup as unsaved
* Fixes newly created shaders not showing up if shaders folder wasn't present yet (https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/issues/491)
* Fixes new installed HDE extensions not getting picked up 
* Fixes Elementa tooltips no longer working (regression introduced in 2021.4.11)
* Some Skia performance improvements, see https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/elementa-frame-rate-issues/20798/14
