## New
* Update to .NET 6
* Update to Stride 4.1
* Support for "new" nuget packages
* Packages get pre-compiled. Saves startup time and memory.
* C# projects can be referenced directly
* Exporter stores its settings in `*.props` file. That file (and / or optional `*.targets` file) can be used to define custom actions on export.

## Changes
* Exported apps no longer have a `lib` subfolder where all the assemblies are. It wasn't possible to support this directory layout.
