# vvvv gamma 5.0
[Download preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download)

## New
* Update to .NET 6
* Update to Stride 4.1
* Support for "new" nuget packages
* Packages get pre-compiled. Saves startup time and memory.
* C# projects can be referenced directly
* Exporter stores its settings in `*.props` file. That file (and / or optional `*.targets` file) can be used to define custom actions on export.
* New command (Ctrl + Shift + K) to create getters and setters (accessors) for selected pads in one go
* ImGui library added, Channels refined for easy data binding  
* All libraries are open source (VL.StandardLibs)
* Exported applications are of smaller size, they no longer have a dependency on VL.Lang
* All packages (nuget or source) do by default get pre-compiled. With the `--editable-packages` startup flag one can opt-out of this behaviour.
* Adds new package `VL.TestFramework` which can be used by external libraries to test their documents
* Lock regions added
* HDE API: added ActiveLiveCanvasStream
* Instances of generic types using adaptive nodes can get created dynamically. Used by AlchemX / Kairos.

## Changes
* Exported apps no longer have a `lib` subfolder where all the assemblies are. It wasn't possible to support this directory layout.
* Improved symbol browsing (Ctrl + ,)
  * Works for still closed documents (precompiled ones) for when browsable packages is activated
  * Improved search result ordering
  * Clarity: now showing package first in second line, then file
* Tooltip shows file path of shaders
* A `Path` is now serialized relative to the entry point and not the document where the call to `Serialize` is made
* Simplified adaptive node error message 

## Fixes
* Opening recently saved documents should no longer showup as unsaved
* Fixes new installed HDE extensions not getting picked up 
* Fixes Elementa tooltips no longer working (regression introduced in 2021.4.11)
* Some Skia performance improvements, see https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/elementa-frame-rate-issues/20798/14
* Fixes UDP nodes opening socket in first frame even though enabled == false
* Fixes DatagramSender node not completing its send tasks if incoming observable doesn't complete
* Bool IOBox: Fixes "bang iobox doesn't light up consistently when triggered from input".
* Further improvements regarding stability and playfulness on hotswap, package compilation, exception handling
* Nodebrowser: got rid of some glitches 
* ResampleBSpline nodes: Closed mode fixed
* Fix for WithValueFromExpression (used by Channel.Select (ByPath)
* Open node command grayed out if stemming from a node factory

## Stride
* Stride now uses the more modern [flip model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model) for its present path
* Increases the default of read back nodes from 3 to 5 frames and adds a runtime warning in case the GPU gets stalled by one of these nodes
* Fixes default value handling of compute shader inputs
* Fixes newly created shaders not showing up if shaders folder wasn't present yet (https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/issues/491)
* Some performance improvements to `ImagePlayer (Stride)`
  * No more white flashes, because the frame to be displayed will be waited upon
  * Better resource utilization - the default pre-load count of 2 now leads to correct results
  * Increases the read buffer size from 128 KB to 8 MB (vs 2 MB in vvvv beta) thereby reducing overall disk usage
* Updates VL.Stride with Kopffarbens Tesselation feature 
* FlatCamera added
* Fixes double transformation of AxisAndGrid
* Stride rendering: fixes Stride.Redenring.Within... nodes
