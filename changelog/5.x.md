# vvvv gamma 5.0
[Download preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download)

## New
* Update to .NET 6
* Improved startup time and memory usage due to [packages now being read-only](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/language/compilation.html#read-only-packages)
* New commandline argument: `--editable-packages` to opt-out of the read-only default for individual packages
* All libraries are open source: [Introducing VL.StandardLibs](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2023/introducing-vl.standardlibs/)
* C# projects can be referenced directly, allowing for a hybrid visual/textual workflow
* Support for "new" nuget packages
* Exported applications are of smaller size, they no longer have a dependency on VL.Lang
* Exporter stores its settings in a `*.props` file. That file (and/or an optional `*.targets` file) can be used to define custom actions on export
* ImGui library added, Channels refined for easy data binding  
* Lock regions added
* HDE API: added ActiveLiveCanvasStream
* New command (Ctrl + Shift + K) to create getters and setters (accessors) for selected pads in one go
* Nodes from external files (shaders, csproj) now have "Show in Explorer" entry in their context menu
* Adds new package `VL.TestFramework` which can be used by external libraries to test their documents
* Instances of generic types using adaptive nodes can get created dynamically. Used by AlchemX / Kairos.
* `New > C# File` and `New > Shader` dialogs for easy C# / Shader creation.
* Helpbrowser's `Learn` tab can be set to open by default.

## Changes
* Exported apps no longer have a `lib` subfolder where all the assemblies are. It was technically not possible to support this directory layout anylonger
* Improved [SymbolFinder](https://thegraybook.vvvv.org/reference/hde/finders.html#symbolfinder)
  * Works for documents from read-only packages, when the "Browsable packages" setting is activated
  * Improved search result ordering
  * Clarity: In second line, now shows package, then file
* Tooltip shows file path of shaders
* A `Path` is now serialized relative to the entry point and not the document where the call to `Serialize` is made
* Simplified adaptive node error message
* `VL.EditingFramework` is split into `VL.EditingFramework` and only Skia related `VL.EditingFramework.Skia`

## Fixes
* Improvements regarding stability and playfulness on hotswap, package compilation, exception handling
* Nodebrowser: got rid of some glitches 
* Opening recently saved documents should no longer showup as unsaved
* Fixes new installed HDE extensions not getting picked up 
* Bool IOBox: Fixes "bang iobox doesn't light up consistently when triggered from input".
* Fixes Elementa tooltips no longer working (regression introduced in 2021.4.11)
* Some [Skia performance improvements](https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/elementa-frame-rate-issues/20798/14)
* Fixes UDP nodes opening socket in first frame even though enabled == false
* Fixes DatagramSender node not completing its send tasks if incoming observable doesn't complete
* ResampleBSpline nodes: Closed mode fixed
* Fix for WithValueFromExpression, used by Channel.Select (ByPath)
* Open node command grayed out if stemming from a node factory
* Skia: 
  - `ImageWriter` keeps jpg/jpeg extension of the path if Jpeg format is selected
  - fixes `LottiePlayer` and adds `LottiePlayer (FrameBased)`


## Stride
* Update to [Stride 4.1](https://www.stride3d.net/blog/release-stride-4-1/) 
* Adds [support for OpenXR](https://visualprogramming.net/blog/2022/introducing-support-for-openxr/)
* Stride now uses the more modern [flip model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model) for its present path
* Increases the default of read back nodes from 3 to 5 frames and adds a runtime warning in case the GPU gets stalled by one of these nodes
* Fixes default value handling of compute shader inputs
* Fixes [newly created shaders not showing up](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/issues/491) if shaders folder wasn't present yet 
* Performance improvements for the `ImagePlayer` nodes
  * No more white flashes, because the frame to be displayed will be waited upon
  * Better resource utilization - the default pre-load count of 2 now leads to correct results
  * Increases the read buffer size from 128 KB to 8 MB thereby massivly reducing overall disk usage
* Adds new [Tesselation feature](https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/pull/589) 
* Adds FlatCamera node
* Fixes double transformation of AxisAndGrid
* Fixes Stride.Redenring.Within... nodes
* `Insert` and `Insert (UV)` are added to the Stride.Texture.Utils
