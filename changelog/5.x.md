# vvvv gamma 5.0
[Download preview](https://visualprogramming.net/#Download)

## New
* Update to .NET 6
* Update to Stride 4.1
* Support for "new" nuget packages
* Packages get pre-compiled. Saves startup time and memory.
* C# projects can be referenced directly
* Exporter stores its settings in `*.props` file. That file (and / or optional `*.targets` file) can be used to define custom actions on export.
* New command (Ctrl + Shift + K) to create getters and setters (accessors) for selected pads in one go
* All libraries are open source (VL.StandardLibs)
* Exported applications are of smaller size, they no longer have a dependency on VL.Lang
* All packages (nuget or source) do by default get pre-compiled. With the `--editable-packages` startup flag one can opt-out of this behaviour.
* Adds new package `VL.TestFramework` which can be used by external libraries to test their documents

## Changes
* Exported apps no longer have a `lib` subfolder where all the assemblies are. It wasn't possible to support this directory layout.
* Better ordering of search results (Ctrl + ,)
* Tooltip shows file path of shaders
* A `Path` is now serialized relative to the entry point and not the document where the call to `Serialize` is made

## Fixes
* Opening recently saved documents should no longer showup as unsaved
* Fixes new installed HDE extensions not getting picked up 
* Fixes Elementa tooltips no longer working (regression introduced in 2021.4.11)
* Some Skia performance improvements, see https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/elementa-frame-rate-issues/20798/14
* Fixes UDP nodes opening socket in first frame even though enabled == false
* Fixes DatagramSender node not completing its send tasks if incoming observable doesn't complete

## Stride
* Stride now uses the more modern [flip model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3ddxgi/dxgi-flip-model) for its present path
* Increases the default of read back nodes from 3 to 5 frames and adds a runtime warning in case the GPU gets stalled by one of these nodes
* Fixes default value handling of compute shader inputs
* Fixes newly created shaders not showing up if shaders folder wasn't present yet (https://github.com/vvvv/VL.Stride/issues/491)
* Some performance improvements to `ImagePlayer (Stride)`
  * No more white flashes, because the frame to be displayed will be waited upon
  * Better resource utilization - the default pre-load count of 2 now leads to correct results
  * Increases the read buffer size from 128 KB to 8 MB (vs 2 MB in vvvv beta) thereby reducing overall disk usage
