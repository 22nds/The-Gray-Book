= VL - Visual Programming

An introduction to software development using VL.

VL is: 

* a statically typed visual programming language
* a development environment for the same
* a node and data type library

VL can

* compile and run code dynamically

VL is available as

* a package for vvvv

VL is targeted at developers who 

* prefer visual over textual code
* prefer interactive prototyping programming over edit/compile/fix error/compile/run
* are looking for data flow, object oriented and functional style programming metaphors 

We'll mainly be looking at things pure VL, and still see the differences to vvvv here and there. The focus yet is on explaining pure VL from the ground up, thus working as a guide for the still to upcoming standalone system. A special chapter will show how to integrate VL-nodes into your vvvv projects.
