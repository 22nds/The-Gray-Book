# VL for vvvv users

WARNING: Images missing!

## Project Structure
### .v4p versus .vl
In vvvv a each patch has its own .v4p file. This is different with VL. Here many patches can be collected within a single .vl file or VL document, as we call it. Therefore small VL projects typically only have one VL document, even if they consist of multiple patches. 

### Patches
In vvvv each patch is the same. VL for now has two different types of patches:

** Utility Patches
*** can define multiple operations
*** can't have fields
** Datatype Patches
*** define a datatype
*** can define multiple operations for that datatype
*** can have fields to store data

### Operations
In vvvv each patch defines exactly one operation. In VL a patch can define any number of operations. Each operation has a user-specified name and is assigned a random color to be able to distinguish them visually. The color has no further meaning.

### IOBoxes
In vvvv an IOBox can be used to set or display values. By giving an IOBox a descriptive name you turn it into an inlet of the patch. In VL we distinguish between Inlets and Constants, Outlets and OutBoxes. 

### Nodes
In vvvv all nodes look the same. Distinguish between Operation and Process nodes: 

## Language
### Values
In vvvv there is only one numerical type. It is called simply "Value" and it is internally represented by a Float64. Any output of type Value can be connected to any input of type value even though they may have different subtypes, like Integer, Boolean, or Bang. 

In VL there are many different types for values:
* Float32
* Float64
* Integer32
* Integer64
* Boolean
and for now you can only connect from lower to higher precision, eg. from Integer32 to Float32 (or Float64) but not the other way round.

### Spreads
In vvvv every connection between two pins is a spread. A spread can have 0 or 1 slices but still it would be a spread. 

In VL this is more defined: You need to understand three things:
* There is a difference between a single value or a spread with a single value. 
* When we talk of a spread of Integer32, strings or colors, we write: Spread<Integer32>, Spread<String>, Spread<RGBA>
* A Spread is only one type of collection. Another common type of collection would be a Sequence or a HashSet, but we can imagine many different types of collections. Anyway for a start you'll mostly use Spreads and only sometimes Sequences.

### No more framedelay
Instead of a FrameDelay in VL you'll create a field and use a Reader to read from and a Writer to write to it. See link:reference/vl/fields.adoc[Fields]

### Naming Conventions
Name [Category.Subcategory] (Version1 Version2)

## User Interface
### The NodeBrowser
The VL nodebrowser is a totally different beast. 

### Open a patch
When in vvvv you'd rightclick a node to open its corresponding patch in VL you middleclick it instead as you would in a brwoser to open a link in a new tab. 

### No more Inspektor
Middleclick a Constant or rightclick on its label -> Configure to bring up the configuration for the constant.

### No more hidden values in pins
In vvvv you can change the value on a pin directly. This can be confusing, because when looking at a node you don't see which pin has a value other than its default. In VL you can only change a pins value by connecting a Constant.
