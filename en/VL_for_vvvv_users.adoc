# VL for vvvv users

_randomly collecting topics here..._

## Project Structure
* In vvvv a each patch has its own .v4p file. This is different with VL. Here many patches can be collected within a single .vl file or VL document, as we call it. Therefore small VL projects typically only have one VL document, even if they consist of multiple patches. 

* In vvvv each patch defines exactly one operation. In VL a patch can define any number of operations. Each operation has a user-specified name and is assigned a random color to be able to distinguish them visually. The color has no further meaning.

* In vvvv each patch is the same. VL for now has two different types of patches:

** Utility Patches
*** can define multiple operations
*** can't have fields
** Datatype Patches
*** define a datatype
*** can define multiple operations for that datatype
*** can have fields to store data



Distinguish between Inlet and Constant, Outlet and OutBox

Distinguish between Operation and Process nodes

You now open a patch via middleclick (as you would open a link in a browser)

No more Inspektor
