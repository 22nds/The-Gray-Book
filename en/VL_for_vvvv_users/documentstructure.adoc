== .v4p versus .vl
In vvvv a each patch has its own .v4p file. This is different with VL. Here many patches can be collected within a single .vl file or VL document, as we call it. Therefore small VL projects typically only have one VL document, even if they consist of multiple patches. 

Then there are 3 different types of patches in vl:

* Datatype Patches
* The Document Patch
* Group Patches

== Datatype Patches
Datatype Patches are the ones that most closely correspond to what you're familiar with from vvvv. A new datatype patch is created by pressing CTRL+P or CTRL+Shift+P. Here you can patch as usual.

== The Document Patch
Every vl document has one toplevel patch that provides an overview of its content. You can always reach it by pressing ALT+P

== Group Patches
You can create a new Group patch by typing 'Group' in the Nodebrowser. Group patches are merely organisational elements in that hey have no purpose other than letting you structure/modularize your program.
