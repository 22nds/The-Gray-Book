=== Main Menu
There is no middleclick main menu in VL. Instead all main functions hide behind the little gray quad in the topleft corner. Next to the quad menu is the Document Menu with entries concerning the active document. 

=== The NodeBrowser
The VL nodebrowser is a totally different beast. See link:reference/hde/the_nodebrowser.adoc[The NodeBrowser].

=== Inspektor
There is no global Inspektor in VL. Instead an Inspektor pops up next to inspectable elements on demand. MiddleClick an Input/Output, Pad or IOBox or rightclick on its label -> Configure to bring up its Inspektor.

=== Finder
See link:reference/hde/finders.adoc[Finders].

=== TTY Renderer
There is no TTY or error console yet.

=== Docking Patches
In VL all open patches are docked by default. A session of open tabs cannot be saved.

=== Open a patch
Nodes that have a little right-pointing arrow symbol can be entered with a middleclick or rightclick -> Open.
