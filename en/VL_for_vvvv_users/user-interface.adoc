=== Main Menu
In VL the Main Menu hides behind the little gray quad in the topleft corner. Next to it is the Document Menu with entries concerning the active document. 

=== The NodeBrowser
The VL nodebrowser is a totally different beast. See link:reference/hde/the_nodebrowser.adoc[The NodeBrowser].

=== Inspektor
There is no global Inspektor in VL. Instead an Inspektor pops up next to inspectable elements on demand. MiddleClick an Input/Output, Pad or IOBox or rightclick on its label -> Configure to bring up its Inspektor.

=== Finder
There is no finder yet.

=== TTY Renderer
There is no TTY or error console yet.

=== Docking Patches
In VL all open patches are docked by default. A session of open tabs cannot be saved.

=== Open a patch
Nodes that have a little right-pointing arrow symbol can be entered with a middleclick or rightclick -> Open.
