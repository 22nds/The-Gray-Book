VL is a visual programming language for the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Framework[.NET Framework]. It combines dataflow with features known from object-oriented programming and builds directly to the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language[.NET Intermediate Language].

With direct access to all of .NETs libraries you can basically use it as just another .NET language like C# or F#. But since most of those libraries were not created with dataflow in mind, we've curated a library for you that is much more comfortable to use and is the default referenced library when creating a new VL document. The VL.CoreLib is built on top of link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard[.NET Standard].

## Renamings
When assembling the VL.CoreLib we took a few curatorial decisions that may confuse .NET developers, so here we want to give you an overview of some renamings we did:

## Language Features
If you're familiar with programming C#, you'll mostly find yourself around with VL. Here are a few things things that will be new to you though:

### Spreads
The main collection type in VL is called __Spread__ and its individual entries are called __Slices__. The Spread is an immutable collection with one special feature: If you're calling `GetSlice(Index)` on it, with an index that exceeds its count, instead of an error you get the slice with the index taken module the count.

E.g. if you have a spread with 5 slice and you're asking for slice 7, you get slice 2.

### Generic By Default

### Process Nodes

### Foreach with Multiple Inputs
