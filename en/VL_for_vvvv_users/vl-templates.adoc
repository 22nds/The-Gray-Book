= VL Templates

When creating a VL node from vvvv you have the choice between two available templates for cloning them via kbd:[Ctrl] + Leftclick

* Template (Value)
* Template (Value Stateless)

Cloning either creates a new .vl document. The first template then creates a ProcessDefinition in that document while the stateless template creates an OperationDefinition with the given name, category and version.

== Make VL nodes show up in VVVV
So cloning a template creates a new .vl document and one nodefinition (process or operation). In order to make additional nodes created in vl show up in vvvv, they must be:

- non-generic
- in the category VVVV

and either:

- an OperationDefinition
- a ProcessDefinition with ProcessNode enabled
