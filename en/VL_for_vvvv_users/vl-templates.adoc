= VL Templates

When creating a VL node from vvvv you have the choice between two available templates for cloning them via kbd:[Ctrl] + Leftclick

* Template (Value)
* Template (Value Stateless)

Cloning either creates a new .vl document. The first template then creates a processdefinition in that document while the stateless template creates an operationdefinition.

== Make VL nodes show up in VVVV
In order to make additional process- or operation nodes show up in vvvv they must be:

- non-generic
- in the category VVVV
