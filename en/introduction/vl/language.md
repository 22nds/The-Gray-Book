# The Language

This chapter will explain the basic building blocks of a program patched in VL. We'll focus on what is expressible and what every programming language is about: telling the computer what to do. We'll only briefly touch how to edit or even refactor programs. See "The Development Environment" for getting started with the UI. We'll only discuss some basic nodes and data types that are central or work for illustration purposes. For more about nodes see "Libraries".

#### Looking at Things
A rough overview laying out the groundwork for later chapters that look **into** things.

#### More On Data
A detailed look into what data is and how it may be used.

#### Patches as Defining Constructs
A patch is both a container construct together with its content. Basically like a canvas. In this chapter we'll look at the canvas itself, not the painting.

#### Inside Patches
The painting.

#### Inside Data Type Patches
A modern painting.

Oh come on! Start reading the content already! This is getting far to metaphoric...
