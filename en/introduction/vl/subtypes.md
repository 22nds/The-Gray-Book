# Sub Types

As already mentioned in [Spreads and Other Collections](spreads.md) a Spread can be seen as a List or just a Sequence.

Some spread (0, 1, 2) has the type Spread. Nobody wants to discuss that.

And still this data (0, 1, 2) can also be understood as data of a more general purpose type. We can even state that a Spread is just some object. This is not saying much but still is true.
