= Documentation Window

Using the documentation window you can add documentation to all your elements. Press kbd:[Ctrl + M] to open it and then use the 3 pulldowns on top to navigate:

* Documents
* Patches in the selected document
* Operations in the selected patch

As long as the _Attach_ checkbox is not activated navigating between the patchs in the editor lets the documentation window follow the active patch.
