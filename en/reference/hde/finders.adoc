= Finders
:experimental:

The development environment offers 3 different ways to find stuff quickly

- Finder: looks for strings in the active patch
- SymbolFinder: looks for documents, patches, operations, pads
- Show All References: show all applications of a definition

== Finder
Press kbd:[Ctrl + F] in any patch to search for local occurances of strings. Type a string and then use kbd:[F3] or kbd:[Enter] to navigate through the results. Press kbd:[ESC] to hide the results again.

== SymbolFinder
Press kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + F] to globally search for any symbol including the given string. Use the shortcuts below followed by a " " (space) to narrow down your search:

[cols="1,5", options="header"]
