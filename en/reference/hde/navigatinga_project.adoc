# Navigating a Project

A project in VL typically consists of a single .vl document that holds one ore more patches. In addition a document can depend on other documents or Nugets whose nodes it can access.

In the main menubar you always see the filename of the document you're currently working on, ie. the "Active Document". 

## Patches
Next to the active document you see two pulldowns labeled "P" (Patches) and "C" (Categories). Navigate to either of the two pulldowns to see the content of the active document. Both give you access to all patches in the active document only sorted by different aspects:

- use the P pulldown to navigate an alphabetically sorted list of patches 
- use the C pulldown to navigate a the list of patches sorted by categories

Since typically in a normal project you won't use too many categories the alphabetical list will be more convenient to use. But in documents that you use to structure a more extensive library with nodes sorted in many categories the C pulldown will be more helpful.

## Dependencies
Click the active documents filename in the menubar to manage its dependencies. There are three different types of dependencies:

* Nugets
* Files

### Nugets
Navigate to Nugets to see a list of all available nugets that you can check or uncheck by rightclicking them.

Each nuget is a collection of documents (.vl, .cs,..) that provide nodes for your document. By selecting a nuget you'll have access to all nodes in that package via the nodebrowser in the active document. 

In the "Other" section you find all nugets that are not relevant for VL in that they don't expose nodes. Selecting them does not do anything to your document for now. 

### Files
In addition to nugets you can also reference individual files of the following types:

* .vl
* .dll
* .vlimport

Choose "Add Existing..." to select a file via the file browser. All nodes that are exposed by those files will be available in your active document via the nodebrowser.

### Forward
In this section you see a listing of all nugets and files combined. Here you can specify if the nodes of a specific dependency will be forwarded or not.

By default if you add a dependency to a document you get only the nodes the dependency exposes directly. Dependencies can depend on other dependencies which you don't see by default. 

Only if you check a dependency as "Forward" it will also be seen by documents that only include their parent document.
