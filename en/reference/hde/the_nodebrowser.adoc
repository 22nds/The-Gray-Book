# The NodeBrowser

The NodeBrowser has 3 sections:

* topleft: shortcuts to pads 
* bottomleft: shortcuts to regions
* center: listing of available nodes

## Shortcuts to Pads
First enter a name and then double click the button of the type of pad you want to create. 

## Shortcuts to Regions
Click the region you want to create.

## Available Nodes
There are different ways to navigate the list of available nodes:

* by categories
* by tags

In both cases it helps to be familiar with the icons: 

- Category
- Type Category
- Process Node
- Operation Node

Hovering any entry that represents a node will show you the nodes Inputs and Outputs in the topright corner of the NodeBrowser and a tooltip will show you the description associated with the node if available. 

When you're clicking an entry that represents a node two things may happen:

* if your selection is unambiguous the node will be created
* there are situations where a selection is ambiguous in which case the NodeBrowser prompts you to specify more details be choosing from the offered options

### Search By Category
Nodes in VL are organised in a hierarchical structure of categories. When opening the NodeBrowser you're being presented with a list of available toplevel categories. Click any of the categories to enter it. 

Note that when entering a category a tag appears in the bottom right part of the NodeBrowser. The listing is now filtered by this tag. Choose another category from the listing to refine your search or remove a tag by clicking on the X button next to it.

### Search By Tag
Enter any search term and see the list filtered by it.
