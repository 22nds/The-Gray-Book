= Dependencies

VL Documents can reference 2 different types of dependencies:

* Nugets
* Files

When a document references a dependency, it means that all public nodes in the dependency will be available in the nodebrowser of the referencing document. 

== Nugets
Nugets are packages of nodes that in turn can contain many .dll and/or .vl files. To reference a nuget go to:


== Files

=== From Disk

=== From the .NET Framework GAC
