= Dependencies

VL Documents can reference 3 different types of dependencies:

* VL Nugets
* .NET Nugets
* Files

When a document references a dependency, it means that all public nodes in the dependency will be available in the nodebrowser of the referencing document. 

== Nugets
link:https://www.nuget.org/[NuGet] is the package managing system for .NET. Nugets are packages that can contain many .dll and/or .vl files that expose nodes to the referencing document.

=== VL vs. .NET Nugets
A VL Nuget is a nuget specifically created for use with vl that won't work for any other link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CLI_languages[.NET language]. It is still a valid nuget in the original terms of NuGet but since it contains .vl documents it will not be useable outside of vl. 

A .NET Nuget on the other hand is more generally targetting any .NET language.

You can reference either VL or .NET nugets via the menu by navigating to it and pressing the right mousebutton to toggle its selection:

=== Unmanaged/Native dependencies
Some nugets are shipping with or depending on unmanaged/native .dlls which cannot be picked up by vl automatically since there isn't a pattern in the nuget specification as to how those should be handled. So in order to get such unmanaged dependencies of a nuget picked up, for now you'll have to add a search-path for vl via a batch file, like so:

----
SET PATH=%PATH%;c:\path\to\nugets\nativelibs
----

== Files
A vl document can reference other .vl documents and managed .dll files. 

=== From Disk
Here are 3 ways to reference local files:

* Drop a .vl or .dll file onto the patch 
* Press kbd:[Ctrl + R] to select files via a file browser
* Via menu:Document[Dependencies > Files > Add Existing...]

.Add existing File as dependency.

=== Libraries from the GAC (Global Assembly Cache)

By default .NET comes with a large number of assemblies that can be referenced. They are stored in the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/gac[GAC] on all machines that have .NET installed and can be referenced from there via:

* Press kbd:[Ctrl + Shift + R]
* via menu:Document[Dependencies > Files > Add .NET Framework Assembly...]

.Use kbd:[Ctrl + F] in this window to find libraries in the GAC.
