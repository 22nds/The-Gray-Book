= Libraries
A library is a set of types and nodes which are designed in a reuseable and modular manner. 

A VL document has three methods to extend its node list:

* Referencing another VL files as dependency
* Referencing .vlimport files which extend binaries with type and node attributes
* Referencing binaries which have type and node attributes compiled into it
