= Libraries

A library is a set of types and nodes which are designed in a reuseable and modular manner to extend the node list in a VL document.

A VL document has three methods to extend its node list:

* Referencing another VL files as dependency
* Referencing .vlimport files which decorate binaries with type and node attributes
* Referencing binaries which have type and node attributes compiled into it
