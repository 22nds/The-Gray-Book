= Forwarding .NET Libraries

By link:/reference/libraries/using_net_libraries.adoc[Using .NET Libraries] we have direct access to a vast range of nodes for patching in VL. Many of those libraries though will not be very convenient to use in the dataflow context of VL. 

To make those libraries accessible to more casual users we often want to curate exactly what nodes and types of the original library are seen by them. Forwarding allows us to insert a very thin wrapper layer to conveniently provide such curation.

== Reasons to Forward
- Selectively forward types and operations of .NET .dlls
- Adjust VL relevant meta information on the types (like mutability and known type structure)
- Choose a relevant category for the nodes and types in VL
- Do simple unit or type conversions (e.g. from angles in radians to angles in cycles)
- Rename pins, operations, types
- Set default values for input pins
- Provide convenience process nodes that wrap some low-level functionality into more high-level nodes
- Design lifetime management of disposable objects

[NOTE]
====
An important aspect when forwarding types from a library is that we don't want to introduce new wrapper-types. Therefore using Forwarding does not introduce new types! 

Forwarded types are compatible to the original library in order to allow users to fall back to low-level functionality of the original library and combine that with the use of the higher-level wrapper. 

Also, the wrapper can act as a useful layer to shield the end-user of a vl-library from changes in the original library. Instead of confronting a vl-user directly with the (e.g. naming) changes of an original library, forwards allow us to implement ways to not break patches in such cases. 
====

== Forwarding Types
In a typical scenario you create _one .vl document_ to forward types from one or more .NET .dlls. This .vl document is then the only thing a user of your library will have to reference.

=== Create Type Forward

==== 1. Set a reference to the .NET .dll
In a blank .vl document set a reference to the .NET .dll(s) you want to forward types from. See link:/reference/libraries/dependencies.adoc[Dependencies].

==== 2. Prepare a Category Group
An imported type will show-up in the category defined by the group you place it in. So, create groups for every category of your library in the Document Patch.

.Groups (representing categories) in a document's main patch.

NOTE: Empty categories are not showing-up in the NodeBrowser.

==== 3. Create Type Forward
There are two ways to create a type forward:

===== Drag-Drop from the Solution Explorer

. Open the group you want to drop the type into
. Open the Solution Explorer
. Choose '.NET Dependencies'
. Find the type you want to forward
. Drag-Drop the type into the group

.Drag-Drop type from Solution Explorer into group.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-dragndrop.png[]


===== Manually

. Open the group you want to drop the type into
. Create a new _Process_ patch
. Set the `patch type` to 'Forward'
. Set a `type-annotation` on the patch

.Left: Click the `patch type` drop-down and set 'Forward'. Right: Click the `type-annotation` and choose a type from the NodeBrowser.

=== Configure Type Forward
==== Rename Type
Typically you may want to keep the name of a type from the original library. If you have a good reason to rename it, simply do so.

.Renaming a Type.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-Rename.png[]

==== Forward All Nodes
When you create a type forward, every operation of the type is forwarded as a node by default. If you prefer to selectively forward only a subset of a types' operations, uncheck the 'Forward All Nodes' option.

.Forward All Nodes.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ForwardAll.png[]
 
NOTE: Even if the option is activated you can still adjust the forwarding of individual operations by simply creating an operation forward for them, see below.

==== Mutability
+++.NET Libraries+++ don't come with meta information of whether a type is mutable or not. Because of this we need to tell VL manually by setting the mutable flag accordingly.

.Mutable checkbox.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-Mutable.png[]

Since most .NET types are mutable, this flag is activated by default. Here is how to detect whether a .NET type is immutable:

* It only has readonly fields
* Each of its fields is of an immutable type
* Optional: it has `WithFoo(TFoo newValue)` methods to get a new instance (= a new immutable snapshot) of that type, where all fields are set to the values as in this instance, but only the field `Foo` is set to the `newValue`.

In an upcoming version of C# watch out for 'Records'. They should ease the pain for writing immutable types.

==== Known Type Structure
TODO

*Image: Known Type Structure*

==== Create Default
Member operation nodes often expect a type on their main input and throw a 'Null Pointer Exception' as long as nothing is connected to it. In order to prevent this, we need to tell vl how it can construct a default instance of a type whenever needed. 

To do so, simply create an operation called `CreateDefault` in a type forward patch and implement it so that it returns an instance of the type. Often this requires nothing more than returning the result of a constructor of the type.

.Creating a Default for a type.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-CreateDefault.png[]

==== Process Node
Each type forward can also directly expose a process node. This is exactly the same as exposing a process node from an ordinary patch. See..

If you want to expose more than one process node from a single type forward, you have to create an extra patch for each additional process node that does not forward the type but simply uses the types operations to create the desired process.

== Forwarding Operations
To create forwards for individual operations:

- Open the type you want to drop the operation into
- Open the Solution Explorer
- Choose '.NET Dependencies'
- Find the operation you want to import
- Drag-Drop the operation into the type

.Dropping the operation into type.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-DroppingOperation.png[]

NOTE: You can also select multiple operations and drop those into the patch at once. 

=== Show Category

Rightclick on the header of the operation you're forwarding and choose menu:Configure[Show Category]

.Show Category checkbox
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ShowCategory.png[]

With this flag you can specify whether or not a node shows its type category. Compare the following:

.Vector (Join) [2D.Vector2] does not show its category, while GetSlice [Collections.Spreads] does.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ShowCategory-Compare.png[]

By default member operations have this activated while static operations don't. The only reason to change this default should be nodes like the Vector (Join) where the fact that they are members is not relevant to the readability of a patch.

=== Forward All Pins
.Rightclick on the node you're forwarding and choose menu:Configure[Forward Pins].
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ForwardPins.png[]

By default all pins of an operation are forwarded with their original name. You can disable the automatic forwarding of all pins and only selectively forward pins by manually creating inputs or outputs for them.

.RandomSpread with only its 'Count' input and its 'Output' forwarded.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ForwardPins-Selectively.png[]

Even if the automatic forwarding of all pins is on, you can override forwarding of individual pins by simply connecting an IOBox to them. 

.Hiding a Pin.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ForwardPins-HidingPins.png[]

=== Renaming a Pin
If you have a good reason to change the name of a pin, e.g. in order to have it conform to the link:/reference/vl/namings.adoc[vl naming conventions], then do so by manually creating an input or output for a particular pin and renaming it.

.Renaming a Pin.
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ForwardPins-Rename.png[]

=== Setting a default
Parameters of operations rarely have meaningful defaults. In order to forward a pin with a proper default, manually create an input for a particular pin and set a default for it. 

.Setting a default on an input via Middleclick or menu:Rightclick[Configure]
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ForwardPins-Default.png[]

=== Type or Unit Conversions
Forwards are a good place to do simple type or unit conversions. Consider an operation that takes angles in radians, but you want to use vl-conform cycles.

.SineWave takes the angle in cycles
image::../../images/vl-libraries-wrapping-ForwardPins-Conversion.png[]

== Forwarding Enums
In order to forward an enum from a .dll to the user of a .vl document simply drag-drop the enum onto the patch.
