# Standard Library

The standard library is the default library of VL and referenced by default when a new VL document is created. It consists of patches, import files and DLLs which contain the basic set of nodes in VL.

= Overview
== Basics
Files named _Basics_ contain fundamental types and nodes.

== Standalone
Files named _Standalone_ contain types and nodes which are specific for the standalone VL development environment.

== Integration
Files name _Integration_ contain types and nodes which only make sense when VL is hosted in the vvvv environment.

The files of the standard library are located in the folder resources/library. The subfolders sort the library files by their type:

== Binaries
DLLs which have type and node attributes compiled into it.

== Imports
Import files which import types and operations from third party DLLs. Most of it from the .NET framework binaries.

== Patches
Patches
