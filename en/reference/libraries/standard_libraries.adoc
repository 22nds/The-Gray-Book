# The VL.CoreLib

The default library of VL that provides nodes and types for the most basic patching needs. Here is an overview of the Categories it adds to a document that references it.

|Category
|Description

|*2D*
|2d primitives like Vector2, Rectangle, Circle,... and 2d transformation and collision nodes. Further any 2d related math nodes.

|*3D*
|3d primitives like Vector3, Box, Sphere,... and 3d transformation and collision nodes. Further any 3d related math nodes.

|*Adaptive*
|Nodes that can operate on different datatypes, like a + [Adaptive] that can operate on numbers, strings, colors ... or a Length [Adaptive] that works for 2D and 3D vectors.

|*Animation*
|Timebased nodes like time-generators (LFO, Stopwatch, ...) and filters (Damper, Oscillator, ...). Also has a subcategory *FrameBased* that contains similar nodes that operate framebased instead.

|*Collections*
|Contains most notably the Spread, but also other simple collections like the Sequence, Dictionary and HashSet.

|*Color*
|Contains the RGBA color type and operations to convert to/from different color spaces. 

|*Control*
|Nodes to patch control flow, like FlipFlop, MonoFlop,...

|*Devices*
|Nodes that represent a specific hardware product that interfaces with the VL, like Leap, TheEyeTribe,...

|*IO*
|Mouse, Keyobard and Touch nodes as well as nodes for file IO, Path (directory, filename) and Stream handling. Further nodes that implement input/output protocols and standards in subcategories:
* *IO.Network* for UDP, TCP,...
* *IO.OSC* OpenSoundControl protocol
* *IO.TUIO* Tangible User Interface Objects protocol
* *IO.ArtNet* The ArtNet DMX protocol
...

|*Math*
|General math, algorithms,...

|*Primitive*
|Contains the primitive datatypes, like Bool, Byte, Integer32/64 Float32/64, Char, String

|*Reactive*
|Nodes for reactive programming

|*System*
|DateTime,..

|*Text*
|TypeWriter

|*XML*
|Nodes for XML and JSON parsing and handling
