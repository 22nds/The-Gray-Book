# Fields

Fields are where datatype patches store data. A datatype patch can have any number of fields and you always see them listed in the topleft corner of a patch.

For example you'd use fields named _Position_ and _Velocity_ to store those two properties in a patch that defines a particle. 

## Field Reader and Writer
In a patch you can read from or write to a field by using a Reader or Writer respectively. Fields cannot be created as such but rather they are automatically being created when you add a Reader or Writer. 

Reader/Writer are being created via the nodebrowser. In its left column with buttons choose either Reader or Writer, then enter a name for the field and press OK. Fields and their Reader/Writer are matched by name, so make sure to always be specific about naming, including casing. Rename a Reader/Writer by doubleclicking its label and pressing Enter when finished. 

While you can read from a field multiple times in one operation you can obviously only write to the same field once per operation. Different operations can of course write to the same field. 

## The datatype of a field
By default a field does not have a datatype assigned and  therefore is generic. You see this because a Reader/Writer at first is only an outlined circle. If the circle is filled, it means that the compilier has inferred a type for it which you can see in the tooltip by hovering it. 

If you manually need to specify a type for a field you can annotate its Reader/Writer by middleclicking and entering any type in the editor that pops up. As an alternative to the middleclick you can rightclick the Reader/Writers label and choose -> Configure

You can recognize a reader/writer that has been annotated manually as they have a dot in their circle.
