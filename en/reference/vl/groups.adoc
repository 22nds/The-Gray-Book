Group patches allow you to organize operations and datatypes in a document. Instead of placing all elements directly in a Document Patch you can use groups to structure your program. Every group patch has a corresponding group node.

Create a group via the Nodebrowser and give it a name. By default a group opens a new category with its name. Placing operations or datatypes within a group thus automatically sets their category accordingly.

Changing a groups name therefore automatically changes the category for all the elements it contains (as long as they don't override it)

In the patch tabs group patches can be recognized by their icon.

Groups can be nested.
