# VL

= Overview

The most important components of VL are _nodes_ and _links_.

Nodes and links live on a canvas called _patch_.

One or multiple patches are contained in a VL Document. VL Documents are stored on hard disk.

Every patch can define one or more _operations_. Operations can be created as nodes in other patches.

There are two kinds of patches, one is merely a container for independent operations the other is a data type. If a patch is a data type its operations can store and/or share data via fields. Field can be accessed and/or modified in operations via _readers_ and __writers__.

One VL Document A can reference another VL file B to use its data types and operations. File B is then called a _dependency_ of A.

Patches can also contain _regions_. A region defines a new computational context. There are different kinds of regions.

Nodes and regions can have inputs and outputs calles _pins_. A pin can be defined in a patch or region by a _pad_.

Static data can be entered into an operation using _constants_. Constants are little editors for basic types like numbers, text, colorâ€¦

Links transport data from outputs to inputs. Therefore they define the data flow and execution order of the nodes in an operation.

Each VL file can define one or more _executables_. Executables are patches which are the entry point of the program and can be started by a runtime.
