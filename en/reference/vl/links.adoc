Links are the connections between pins. There are 3 different kinds of links.

Links can have any number of link points that can be added while link is made. Link points can be selected, moved and deleted individually, ie. independent of the selection of the link.

Links can be deleted with a middle-click when they are selected.

Finishing a link on an input with a middle-click starts a new link from the same source.

By default links are not included in a marquee-selection when other elements (nodes, pads, regions) are already in the selection. To force the selection of links in such scenarios press SHIFT.
