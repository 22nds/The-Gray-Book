= Loops

There are two different Loops in VL:

* Loop: a classic for-loop with an _Iteration Count_ input to specify the number of iterations the loop executes
* ForEach: executes for each slice of entering the loop via a splicer. If multiple spreads with different counts are connected via splicers, the lowest of their slice-counts is used.

There are 3 different ways of getting data into a loop

== Direct Connection

== Splicer
SpreadMin behavior!

== Accumulator

---

== Special Pins

There are three special Pins which you can create in loops via the NodeBrowser:

* _Index_: to get the current loop iteration count
* _Break_: set to true to break out of the loop at any time before its actual iteration count is reached
* _Keep_: set to true or false for each loop to specify whether outputs of this slice will be part of the loop output spread or not
