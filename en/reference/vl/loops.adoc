There are two different Loops in VL:

* Loop: a classic for-loop with an _Iteration Count_ input to specify the number of iterations the loop executes
* ForEach: executes for each slice of the 

There are three special Pins which you can create in loops via the NodeBrowser:

* _Index_: to get the current loop iteration count
* _Break_: set to true to break out of the loop at any time before its actual iteration count is reached
* _Keep_: set to true or false for each loop to specify whether outputs of this slice will be part of the loop output spread or not
