# Welcome to vvvv!

Generate interactive 2d or 3d motion graphics. Visualize data coming from network or offline sources. Control lights, lasers, motors or anything else you can connect to a PC. In the end export everything as a standalone program. Missing some functionality? vvvv can consume almost any .NET nuget and can be easily extended using c#.
