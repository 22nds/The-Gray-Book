# The Language

This chapter will explain the basic building blocks of a program patched in VL. 
We'll focus on what is expressible and what every programming language is about: _telling the computer what to do_. 

We'll only briefly touch how to edit or even refactor programs. 
See "The Development Environment" for getting started with the UI. We'll only discuss some basic nodes and data types that are central or work for illustration purposes. For more about nodes see "Libraries".

#### Looking at Things
A rough overview laying out the groundwork for later chapters that look **into** things.

#### Looking into Things
* _More On Data:_ Different shapes of data and how to work with data.
* _Patches as Defining Constructs:_ How to create nodes that others can use.
* _Inside Patches:_ All about data flow and what to do on the canvas.
