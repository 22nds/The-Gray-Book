# Sub Types

As already mentioned in [Spreads and Other Collections](spreads.md) a Spread can be seen as a List or just a Sequence.

Some spread (0, 1, 2) has the type Spread. Nobody wants to discuss that.

And still this data (0, 1, 2) can also be understood as data of a more general purpose type. We can even state that a Spread is just some object. This is not saying much but still is true. At some point we might want to put different things into one Spread. This is possible with a Spread of object, since anything is also an object.

Up to now there are only built in sub type relationships. Later on you might be able to design your own abstract super types and patch your own sub types that belong to the super type.
