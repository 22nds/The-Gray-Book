# Getting Started

So you want to get serious with vvvv? You've come to the right place!

## vvvv beta vs. vvvv gamma vs. VL

* ``vvvv beta`` is the original project, in development since around 2001
* ``vvvv gamma`` is the new version, entirely rewritten from scratch, first released in 2020
* ``VL`` is the name of the visual language that is at the core of vvvv gamma and can optionally also be used in vvvv beta

When we speak of just ``vvvv``, in the past we meant ``vvvv beta``, now we mean ``vvvv gamma``. With ``vvvv`` refer to the whole programming environment, with all its windows, while with ``VL`` we refer more specifically to the language. This distinction is useful, because one fine day VL, the language, may be included in other environments, not only vvvv beta and vvvv gamma...

## Introductions

* [What's different from vvvv beta](beta/VL_for_vvvv_beta_users.md)
* [What .NET programmers should know](VL_for_net_programmers.md)
