# The Document Structure

## .v4p versus .vl
In vvvv beta each patch has its own .v4p file. This is different with VL. Here many patches can be collected within a single .vl file or VL document, as we call it. Therefore small VL projects typically only have one VL document, even if they consist of multiple patches.

Then there are different types of patches in VL. You can learn about them in the [Patches](../../language/patches.md) section.

The [Process Patch](../../language/patches.md#process) is the one that most closely correspond to what you're familiar with from vvvv beta. Watch [HowTo Make a Node](https://youtu.be/wEziL9RTkMM) to learn how you can wrap a group of nodes in a new patch.
