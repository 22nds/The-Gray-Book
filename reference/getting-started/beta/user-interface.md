# The User Interface

## Main Menu
There is no middleclick main menu in VL. Instead all main functions hide behind the little gray `Quad Menu` in the topleft corner. Next to the quad menu is the Document Menu with entries concerning the active document. See [Navigating a Project](../../hde/navigating_a_project.html).

## The NodeBrowser
The VL NodeBrowser is a totally different beast. See [The NodeBrowser](../../hde/the_nodebrowser.md).

## Inspektor
There is no global Inspektor in VL as of yet. Instead an Inspektor pops up next to inspectable elements on demand. MiddleClick an Input/Output, Pad or IOBox or rightclick on its label -> Configure to bring up its Inspektor.

## Finder
See [Finders](../../hde/finders.md).

## TTY Renderer
There is a Console which you an open via `Quad Menu` -> `Windows` -> `Log`.

## Docking Patches
In VL all open patches are docked by default. A session of open tabs cannot be saved.

## Open a nodes patch
Where in beta you'd rightclick a node to open its corresponding patch, in VL you rightclick -> Open. 

## Patching
Removing a link to a pin in vvvv beta would copy the current value into the pin. This is not happening in VL.
