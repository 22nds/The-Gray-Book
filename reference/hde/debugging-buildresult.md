# Build Result

**As of vvvv gamma 5.3-preview 413**

Here you'll see errors, warnings and infos that came up as a result from the build process. Whenever vvvv is building your patches (ie. whenever you make a change), this list is cleared and you'll get a fresh view on the latest issues. 

Most commonly here you'll see errors relating to missing dependency references or missing nodes. Doubleclicking an entry brings you to the source of the message.

So this view is in addition to the visualization of red and yellow nodes in patches and gives you an overview. 

Making sure this list is empty or at least you understand each entry here is the basis of a [healthy app](debugging-apphealth.md).
