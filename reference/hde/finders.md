# Finders

The development environment offers 3 different ways to find stuff quickly

* Finder: looks for strings in the active patch
* SymbolFinder: looks for documents, patches, operations, pads
* Show All References: show all applications of a definition

## Finder
Press <kbd>Ctrl + F</kbd> in any patch to search for local occurrences of strings. Type a string and then use <kbd>F3</kbd> or <kbd>Enter</kbd> to navigate through the results. Press <kbd>ESC</kbd> to hide the results again.
