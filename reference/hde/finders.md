# Finders

The development environment offers 3 different ways to find stuff quickly

* Finder: looks for strings in the active patch
* SymbolFinder: looks for documents, patches, operations, pads
* Show All References: show all applications of a definition

## Finder
Press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>F</kbd></span> in any patch to search for local occurrences of strings. Type a string and then use <span class="keyseq"><kbd>F3</kbd></span> or <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Enter</kbd></span> to navigate through the results. Press <span class="keyseq"><kbd>ESC</kbd></span> to hide the results again.
