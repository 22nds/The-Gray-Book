# Finders

The development environment offers 3 different ways to find stuff quickly

* Finder: looks for strings in the active patch
* SymbolFinder: looks for documents, patches, operations, pads
* Show All References: show all applications of a definition

## Finder
Press `Ctrl + F` in any patch to search for local occurrences of strings. Type a string and then use `F3` or `Enter` to navigate through the results. Press `ESC` to hide the results again.
