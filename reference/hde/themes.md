## Custom Themes

Custom themes can be created using (a limited set of) [CSS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets):
- Copy one of the provided themes from `C:\Program Files\vvvv\vvvv_gamma...\Stylesheets`
- Modify it
- Place it in your user document folder `...\Documents\vvvv\gamma\Themes` to have them available in the Themes tab
