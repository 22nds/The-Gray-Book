# Groups

Groups in VL help you structure elements visually but they don't have any meaning to the language, like [Categories](categories.md) do. So you can use Groups to make extra space on a patch by hiding elements away in a new patch without adding to the category structure. 

Group elements can be added to the [Definitions Patch](patches.md#definitions-patch) via the NodeBrowser, by choosing "Group". Just like Categories, Groups can also be nested.

A group can easily be converted to a [Category](categories.md):
