# Links

Links are the connections between pins. There are 3 different kinds of links.

Links can have any number of link points that can be added while a link is made. Link points can be selected, moved and deleted individually, ie. independent of the selection of the link.

Links can be deleted with a `middle-click`.

Finishing a link on an input with a middle-click starts a new link from the same source.

By default links are not included in a marquee-selection when other elements (nodes, pads, regions) are already in the selection. To force the selection of links in such scenarios press <kbd>SHIFT</kbd>.

By doubleclicking an existing link you bring up the NodeBrowser to choose a node that will be inserted in the link.

While making a link you can:

* doubleclick to bring up the NodeBrowser and choose a node to be connected to the link
* <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + click to create in input or output pin
* <kbd>Shift</kbd> + click to create a pad
* <kbd>Alt</kbd> + click or middleclick to create an IOBox.
