# Geometry

There are no geometry handling libraries tailored for use with VL at this point, but a couple of interesting NuGets to explore:

* [geometry3Sharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/geometry3Sharp/)
* [GShark](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GShark/)
* [Rhino3dm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Rhino3dm/)

For more on working with .NET NuGets, see [Using .NET Libraries](../../extending/using-net-libraries.md).

Watch 2 webinars on the topic in the [NODE20 workshop bundle](https://thenodeinstitute.org/courses/node20-vvvv-workshop-bundle/):
* Using .NET NuGets
* Turning a .NET library into a VL library (which demonstrates working with geometry3Sharp)
