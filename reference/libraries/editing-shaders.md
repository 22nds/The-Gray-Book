# Editing shaders

vvvv does not come with a built-in shader editor. Instead you can use any text editor of your choice. Simply associate the file-ending `.sdsl` with any text editor. If you now Rightclick -> Open on a shader node, the code will open in the specified editor. Whenever you save the file, the shader will be updated.

## Recommended Editors

### Visual Studio 2019
If you already have Visual Studio 2019 installed anyway, it is recommended to install the Stride extension, which comes with the main [Stride installer](https://stride3d.net/download/). This will give you the best shader editing experience, including syntax highlighting and code-completion.

Downside: Installing Visual Studio is a bit of an undertaking, for lighter options see the following.

### Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win) is a lighter version of Visual Studio. Add the "Shader languages support for VS Code" extension and you get syntax highlighting and basic code completion.

### Sublime Text
You can also use the [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) editor with the "HLSL Syntax" package.
