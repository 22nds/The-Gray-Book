## Lobe
[Lobe](https://lobe.ai) allows you to train machine learning models on your local PC, given a range of images and labels. Then it classifies any new image you give it.

NuGet: [VL.Lobe](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Lobe)

## ONNX
NuGet: [ONNX](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VLML.ONNX_03)

## RunwayML
[RunwayML](http://runwayml.com) provides an extensive list of machine learning models that can either be executed on their cloud (paid) or downloaded to be run locally. 

Using VL.RunwayML you get a node for each local or hosted model you want to work with. This makes it a breeze to get results quickly.  

NuGet: [VL.RunwayML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.RunwayML)  

## Wekinator
A set of nodes to easily interact with [The Wekinator]((http://www.wekinator.org/)).
NuGet: [VL.Wekinator](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.Wekinator)

## VLML
NuGet: [VLML](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VLML_Stride)

## VL.OpenCV
Comes with nodes to run PoseNet and Yolo3. CPU only.  
NuGet: [VL.OpenCV](https://www.nuget.org/packages/VL.OpenCV)
