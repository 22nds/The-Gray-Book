## Arduino/Firmata

A set of nodes to communicate with Arduinos (or other microcontrollers) running the [Firmata Protocol](https://github.com/firmata/protocol) is shipping with vvvv. Search the HelpBrowser for examples.

## nanoFramework

Want to use plain C# instead of Arduino, to write code for your microcontrollers, try the [nanoFramework](https://www.nanoframework.net) which allows you to write C# with a reduced set of .NET libraries that run on hardware like ESPs and more.
